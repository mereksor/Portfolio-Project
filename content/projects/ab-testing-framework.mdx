## Overview

Designing and running a rigorous A/B testing framework integrated with extracurricular activities at Cornell. The project applies statistical hypothesis testing to measure the real-world impact of operational or engagement changes within student organizations.

## Status

📋 **Upcoming** — This project has not yet been started. Development is planned to begin in March 2026.

## Goals

- Design statistically sound experiments with proper sample sizing and control groups
- Build a reusable framework for defining, running, and analyzing A/B tests
- Apply the framework to a real extracurricular context to generate actionable insights
- Document methodology and results as a case study in applied statistics

## Tech Stack

- Python (scipy, statsmodels, pandas) for statistical analysis
- Data visualization with Matplotlib / Plotly
- Jupyter Notebooks for experiment documentation
