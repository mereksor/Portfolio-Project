## Overview

Building an intelligent agent platform for NBA 4920 (AI for Business Decisions) that automates the complex process of migrating data from legacy CRM and enterprise software systems. The platform leverages a multi-agent architecture where a primary agent coordinates specialized sub-agents to handle schema mapping, data transformation, validation, and error resolution.

## Status

🔧 **In Progress** — Actively developing agent architecture and migration logic.

## Goals

- Design a multi-agent system with a primary orchestration agent and specialized sub-agents for distinct migration tasks
- Automate schema analysis and mapping between source (legacy) and target database structures
- Build intelligent error detection and resolution — agents should problem-solve migration conflicts autonomously
- Reduce the manual effort and technical debt associated with legacy system migrations

## Architecture

- **Orchestrator Agent**: Manages the overall migration pipeline, delegates tasks, and handles exceptions
- **Schema Mapping Agent**: Analyzes source and target schemas, identifies field mappings, and flags incompatibilities
- **Data Transformation Agent**: Handles type conversions, data cleaning, and format normalization
- **Validation Agent**: Runs integrity checks, identifies data loss risks, and generates migration reports

## Tech Stack

- Python for agent logic and orchestration
- LLM APIs for intelligent decision-making and natural language schema interpretation
- Database connectors for legacy CRM and enterprise platforms
- Testing and validation framework
