## Overview

Working with the President's Council of Cornell Women (PWCC) through Cornell's ORIE 4999 project course to refine and improve their mentor-mentee assignment algorithms. The project involves both algorithmic optimization on the backend and building out a user-facing frontend for program administrators and participants.

## Status

🔧 **In Progress** — Actively developing algorithm refinements and frontend UI.

## Goals

- Analyze and improve the existing mentor-mentee matching algorithm to maximize compatibility and satisfaction
- Develop frontend UI for administrators to manage, review, and override assignments
- Build user-facing functionality for mentors and mentees to input preferences and view matches
- Validate algorithm performance through testing and stakeholder feedback

## Scope

- **Algorithm Refinement**: Evaluate current matching logic, identify inefficiencies, and implement optimized assignment strategies using operations research techniques
- **Frontend Development**: Build interactive UI components for preference input, match visualization, and administrative controls
- **Stakeholder Collaboration**: Work directly with PWCC leadership to align technical solutions with program needs

## Tech Stack

- Python for algorithm development and optimization
- React / Next.js for frontend UI
- Data analysis and validation tooling
